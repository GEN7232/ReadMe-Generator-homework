For this project I created a README generator. To do so I had to install inquirer and from there use its template to ask the user various questions and store the results. The results are sent to a folder labeled "example" with the newly generated README file. In the README I made it so the license badge is also a link to the license documentation. I then use several functions to place the information in the README in specific spots. Then at the table of contents each item links the user to that section on the page.
